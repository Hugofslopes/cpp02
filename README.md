<summary><b>Ex00 - My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form</b></summary>
<p>The goal of this project is to understand what the Orthodox Canonical Form is and what members a class should have to implement it. The canonical form involves having one default constructor, one copy constructor (to create an object based on another), one copy assignment operator, and one destructor. This way, we can create objects of a class like this:

<summary><b>Ex01 - Towards a more useful fixed-point number class</b></summary>
<p> The goal of this exercise is to understand how to use fixed point numbers and creating one object of one calsse that will store one. A fixed-point number is a way of representing real numbers where the decimal point is fixed in a specific position. Unlike floating-point numbers, which can move the decimal point dynamically, fixed-point numbers have a set number of digits before and after the decimal. Fixed-point numbers are especially useful in systems where performance, predictability and resource constraints matter.

Converts the internal fixed-point integer to a float.
Divides by the scaling factor (based on the number of fractional bits).
Returns the real-world floating-point value.

Converts a plain integer into fixed-point format.
Stores it by shifting left to make room for fractional bits.
Prepares the number for fixed-point arithmetic.
